REASON FOR THE PROPOSED SYSTEM:

We are developing a system that is to enable the rest of the campus students to access papers online.
As the students access the papers, they will be able to pay some amount before we release to them
the required papers.

STEPS TO BE UNDERTAKEN AND THE PROPOSED TIME

REQUIREMENTS AND INTERFACE DESIGN

As we discuss about the system we shall be designing different interfaces and from which we are to
use attractive designs and good functionality so as to attract more users into our system.
Preferrably we would use Prototyping for developing our interfaces however, there are also other
softwares for interface design once each of us may be conversant with.
Requirements & Interface design would take us 2 Days at most Starting (August 3 rd , 5 th 2022)

DEVELOPMENT

Each member is supposed to take a part in the development process.
The project will be divided in modules in which each person can show productivity and achieved
good results.
Different Technologies/Languages will be implemented and after which we can integrate and
achieve our goals.
NB: This issue about implementation is still open for discussion.
Depending on the quality we build each time, this could go upto 35 Days.

TESTING

Since we do not want unfair judgments upon what you have developed, whatever one member
develops, another should be able to test it and give a rating preferably X/5 .
Testing may be done preferably by more than one member at a time depending on the schedule.
We shall Test at three levels.
Unit Testing.
Tested by the developer at required time
Integrated Testing.
Tested after integrated components.
System Testing.
Test the system as a whole.
It should take us long as it takes to complete the system.

DEPLOYMENT

Once we are through with the above phases, we shall be ready for this phase.

MAINTENANCE

Once we are through with the above phases, we shall be ready for this phase.
